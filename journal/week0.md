### Install and Verify AWS CLI

I was not able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces due to browser issues
So I decided to use a local environment.

In order to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI

I installed the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```

I attempted to run the command by typing in 'aws' but I recive an error

```
C:\Users|selam>aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.
